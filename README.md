# open-in-edge
This is a Chrome extension that adds an "Open in Edge" option to the context menu.

Microsoft Edge has a feature where downloaded installers have the option to be run directly instead of being downloaded and run. This extension adds a context menu option so you can use that feature while still using Chrome as your default browser.
